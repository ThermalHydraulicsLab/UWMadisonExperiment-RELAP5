Purpose
-------
This repository focuses on cataloging the development of a thermohydraulic model of an experiment at the UW-Madison.
The experiment is a closed-loop, natural circulation system with water as a working fluid.
The model is written for a safety analysis program called [`RELAP5`](http://www.inl.gov/relap5/ "RELAP5 webpage link").

 To do List
------------
- [ ] Need to update the diameters to the experiment's true values
- [ ] Need to adjust the height of the risers and chimney for two phase experiments
- [ ] Comprehensive calculation notebook (for Mr. Kim)
